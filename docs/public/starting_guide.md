# Starting guide

Before starting the “Computer Tools for Linguistic Research” course, each student needs
to take a few steps that will prepare the necessary tools for further work:

1. [Check you have everything you need](#check-everything)
2. [Fork the repository](#creating-fork)
3. [Add collaborators](#adding-collaborators)
4. [Clone a fork of the repository to work locally](#cloning-fork)
5. [Create a project in PyCharm development environment](#creating-project-in-pycharm)
6. [Modify source code and push changes to remote fork](#working-pipeline)
7. [Create a Pull Request](#creating-pull-request)
8. [Continue working](#continue-working)

**Additionally**: [Open a terminal](#open-terminal)

## <a name="check-everything"></a>Check you have everything you need

We assume that after completing the **“Programming for Linguists”** course, you have:

* Python interpreter
* Git version control system
* PyCharm development environment
* GitHub account

If you do not have any of these, go back to steps 1-5 from
[the last course document](https://github.com/fipl-hse/2022-2-level-labs/blob/main/docs/public/starting_guide_ru.md).

## <a name="creating-fork"></a>Fork the repository

To fork a repository on the Github, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository site that your lecturer has sent you.
2. In the upper right corner click `Fork`.

   ![forking_1](../images/starting_guide/github_forking_1.png)

3. Click `Create Fork`.

   ![forking_2](../images/starting_guide/github_forking_2.png)

You have forked a repository! Pay attention to the link in the address bar of the browser:
it should contain your Github username and the name of the repository:
`https://github.com/<your-username>/202X-2-level-ctlr`.

## <a name="adding-collaborators"></a>Add collaborators

Only you can make changes to your fork. However, during the course,
[Dmitry Uraev](https://github.com/dmitry-uraev)
and [Marina Kazyulina](https://github.com/marina-kaz) will need to make changes to your fork:
add changes from the main fork, resolve conflicts, etc. You should add them to **collaborators**,
so they have such an opportunity.

To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the fork site you created in the [Fork the repository](#creating-fork) step.
   1. **NB**: Pay attention to the link in the address bar of the browser:
       it should contain your Github username and the name of the repository.
2. Click `Settings`.

   ![settings](../images/starting_guide/github_settings.png)

3. Select `Collaborators` from the left menu.

   ![add collaborator tub](../images/starting_guide/github_collaborators_tub.png)

4. Click `Add people`.

   ![add collaborator](../images/starting_guide/github_add_collaborator.png)

5. Enter [Dmitry Uraev](https://github.com/dmitry-uraev) and [Marina Kazyulina](https://github.com/marina-kaz)
GitHub username, select it from the list, and click `Add <github-username> to this repository`.

   ![add collaborator finish](../images/starting_guide/github_add_collaborator_finish.png)

You have sent [Dmitry Uraev](https://github.com/dmitry-uraev) and
[Marina Kazyulina](https://github.com/marina-kaz) a request to be added
to the collaborators! Write to them so they can accept your request.

## <a name="cloning-fork"></a>Clone a fork of the repository to work locally

To clone a fork to work locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your fork's website.
2. Click `Code`, select `HTTPS` and click the copy button.

   ![cloning repository](../images/starting_guide/cloning_repository.png)

3. Open a terminal and navigate to a convenient folder.
   1. To move from folder to folder in the terminal, use the command `cd <folder-name>`
   2. If you do not know how to open a terminal, go to the [Open a terminal](#open-terminal) step.
4. Run `git clone <link-to-your-fork>` to clone the repository.
For example, `git clone https://github.com/vitazaytseva/2022-2-level-ctlr.git`.
   1. **NB**: If asked for a password, enter your **Personal Access Token**.

## <a name="creating-project-in-pycharm"></a>Create a project in PyCharm development environment

To create a project in the PyCharm development environment to work with your fork, follow these steps:

1. Open PyCharm and click `Open`.

   ![openning project](../images/starting_guide/openning_project.png)

2. Select the folder with the fork that you cloned in the
[Clone a fork of the repository to work locally](#cloning-fork) step and click `Open`.
   1. **NB**: You need to select the folder with the fork called `202X-2-level-ctlr`, not
      the folder with a specific lab.
3. Click `OK`.
   1. **NB**: If in the `Base Interpreter` field the Python version is < 3.10, then
      click `Python 3.X` and select a newer version from the drop-down list.

![setting interpreter](../images/starting_guide/setting_interpreter.png)

You have created a project!

## <a name="working-pipeline"></a>Modify source code and push changes to remote fork

You will work on different files in each lab folder. The process looks like this:

1. You change the source code in the file.
2. You commit changes using the `git` version control system.
3. You push changes to a remote fork.

### <a name="changing-code"></a>Change the source code

By default, functions do not have implementations - only `pass` in the function body.
Your task is to implement functions according to the provided lab description.

### <a name="committing-changes"></a>Commit changes

**Git** is a version control system that allows developers to save and track changes
to project files at once.

To commit the changes, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the PyCharm development environment.

   ![pycharm open terminal](../images/starting_guide/pycharm_open_terminal.png)

2. Run `git add <path-to-file-with-changes>`. For example,
`git add lab_5_scrapper/scrapper.py`.
3. Run `git commit -m "message"`.
   1. **NB**: It is recommended to use a brief description of the changes you made as `message`.
      This text will be public.

### <a name="pushing-changes"></a>Push changes to remote fork

After the previous step the changes are in a committed state. They are stored only in your system.
To send them to a remote fork, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the PyCharm development environment.

   ![open_terminal](../images/starting_guide/pycharm_open_terminal.png)

2. Run `git pull`.
   1. **NB**: If asked for a password, enter your **Personal Access Token**.
3. Run `git push`.
   1. **NB**: If asked for a password, enter your **Personal Access Token**.
4. Open the main page of your remote fork.
   1. **NB**: You will see the *commit* and the *message* you wrote.

More information about the commands described above can be found
in [the official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## <a name="creating-pull-request"></a>Create a Pull Request

You need to create a Pull Request on GitHub, so mentors can review your changes and validate.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the repository site that your lecturer sent you.
2. Select `Pull Requests`.

   ![pull_request_highlighted](../images/starting_guide/github_pull_request_highlighted.png)

3. Click `New pull request`.

   ![new_pull_request](../images/starting_guide/github_new_pull_request.png)

4. Click `compare across forks`.

   ![compare_across_forks](../images/starting_guide/github_compare_across_forks.png)

5. Click `head repository` and select your fork from the list (it contains your GitHub username).

   ![choose_fork](../images/starting_guide/github_choose_fork.png)

6. Click `Create pull request`.

   ![create_pull_request](../images/starting_guide/github_create_pull_request_final_step.png)

7. Enter a name for the Pull Request.
   1. **NB**: The Pull Request name for **Lab 5** must match the pattern: `Scrapper, Name Surname - 2XFPLX`.
   2. **NB**: The Pull Request name for **Lab 6** must match the pattern: `Pipeline, Name Surname - 2XFPLX`.

      ![name pull request](../images/starting_guide/github_name_pull_request.png)

8. Click `Assignees` and select your mentor from the list.
   1. **NB**: You can find your mentor in [the progress sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19DS6F6_NrgjGbLUjFm9-REuuaECvApEW_o4pHvaXyLQ).

      ![assignees](../images/starting_guide/github_assignees.png)

9. Click `Create pull request`.
   1. **NB**: Your Pull Request will appear in the Pull Requests.

## <a name="continue-working"></a>Continue working

Your work consists in repeating the following steps:

1. [You change the source code](#changing-code).
2. <a name="step-2"></a>[You commit the changes](#committing-changes).
3. [You push changes to a remote fork](#pushing-changes).
   1. They will automatically be updated in the Pull Request you created.
