# Technical Track of Computer Tools for Linguistic Research (2021/2022)

As a part of a compulsory course 
[Computer Tools for Linguistic Research](https://www.hse.ru/edu/courses/749661034)
in [National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/).

This technical track is aimed at building basic skills for retrieving data from external
WWW resources and processing it for future linguistic research. The idea is to automatically 
obtain a dataset that has a certain structure and appropriate content, 
perform morphological analysis using various natural language processing (NLP) 
libraries. [Dataset requirements](./docs/public/dataset.md).

Instructors: 

* [Khomenko Anna Yurievna](https://www.hse.ru/org/persons/65858472) - linguistic track lecturer
* [Lyashevskaya Olga Nikolaevna](https://www.hse.ru/staff/olesar) - linguistic track lecturer

## Technical solution

| Module                | Description                              | Component | Need to get |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:----------|:------------|
| [`pathlib`][1]        | working with file paths                  | scrapper  | 4           |
| [`requests`][2]       | downloading web pages                    | scrapper  | 4           |
| [`BeautifulSoup4`][3] | finding information on web pages         | scrapper  | 4           |
| [`lxml`][4]           | **Optional** parsing HTML                | scrapper  | 6           |
| [`selenium`][5]       | **Optional** processing dynamic websites | scrapper  | 10          |
| [`pymystem3`][6]      | module for morphological analysis        | pipeline  | 6           |

Software solution is built on top of three components:
1. [`scrapper.py`](./lab_5_scrapper/scrapper.py) - a module for finding articles 
   from the given media, extracting text and
   dumping it to the file system. Students need to implement it.
1. `pipeline.py` - a module for processing text: point-of-speech tagging and 
   basic morphological analysis. Students need to implement it.
1. [`article.py`](core_utils/article/article.py) - a module for article abstraction 
   to encapsulate low-level
   manipulations with the article
   
## Handing over your work

Order of handing over:

1. lab work is accepted for oral presentation.
2. a student has explained the work of the program and showed it in action.
3. a student has completed the min-task from a mentor that requires some slight code modifications.
4. a student receives a mark:
   1. that corresponds to the expected one, if all the steps above are completed and mentor is 
      satisfied with the answer;
   2. one point bigger than the expected one, if all the steps above are completed and 
      mentor is very satisfied with the answer;
   3. one point smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over one week later than the 
      deadline and criteria from 4.1 are satisfied;
   4. two points smaller than the expected one, if a lab is handed over more than one week later 
      than the deadline and criteria from 4.1 are satisfied.

> NOTE: a student might improve their mark for the lab, if they complete 
> tasks of the next level after handing over
> the lab.

A lab work is accepted for oral presentation if all the criteria below are satisfied:

1. there is a Pull Request (PR) with a correctly formatted name:
   `Scrapper, <NAME> <SURNAME> - <UNIVERSITY GROUP NAME>`. 
   Example: `Scrapper, Valeriya Kuznetsova - 19FPL1`.
2. has a filled file `target_score.txt` with an expected mark. 
   Acceptable values: 4, 6, 8, 10.
3. has green status.
4. has a label `done`, set by mentor.
